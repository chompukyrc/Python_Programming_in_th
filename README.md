I find that practicing my Python skills on online platforms like https://beta.programming.in.th/ is a great way to improve.

These platforms give me a hands-on learning experience, allowing me to apply the concepts I've learned in a real-world setting.

Additionally, they offer a variety of exercises, challenges, and projects that help me sharpen my skills and improve my problem-solving abilities.
